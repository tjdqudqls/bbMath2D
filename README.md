# bbMath2D Library!

Hello, I'm BB a Korean game developer.
In my current company, I do not have the chance to use C++.
So I decided to start my own project for 2020: making my own 2D physics engine.
With my company getting ready to launch a new game, and my busy personal life raising my toddler, I am starting with a simple Math Library to use in my future projects.

I've never really worked professionally with C++. I have so many uncertainties on the structure of code for now. But I hope to get better soon in the near future.

And I've been wondering on what to put on my ReadMe for these past days and decided to write a journal for each commit or days in order to keep track of my work.
I will one day move these journals to a personal blog :)...

Feel free to criticize on my work!

Finally committing something to this project!
I've quickly written a simple Vec2 struct with all the operators and obvious functions like **Normalize, DotProduct, CrossProduct** end etc...
Then I wanted to add some Unit Testing libraries like NUnit in C#. I came across GoogleTest which   did the work I wanted.
One of the most frustrating work was structuring the project directories and writing the **CMakeLists.txt**.  But I found a simple tutorial where it lead to a good start (https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Cpp_project_setup_with_cmake_and_unit_tests.html#toc_2).

I should probably finish off writing my unit tests for the Vec2D and accelerate my work for matrices, quaternions etc...
